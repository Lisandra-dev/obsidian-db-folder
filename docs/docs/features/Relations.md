## Database Relations

### Introduction

Relations are a very important part of any database. They allow you to model complex relationships between your data. For example, a `User` can have many `Post`s, and a `Post` can have many `Comment`s. This is a one-to-many relationship. You can also have many-to-many relationships, where a `User` can have many `Post`s, and a `Post` can have many `User`s.

### How to Use

To create a relation, you need to create a column with the `Relation` type. You can then select the table you want to relate to (or select same database to relate to itself). You can also select the column you want to use as the relation key as `Rollup`. This is the column that will be used to match the rows. For example, if you have a `User` table with a `Name` column, and a `Post` table with an `Author` column, you can use the `Name` column as the relation key.

## Rollups

Once you create a relation, you can use the `rollup` function to get the related rows. For example, if you have a `User` table with a `Name` column, and a `Post` table with an `Author` column, you can use the `rollup` function to get all the posts for a given user.

### Methods

- Original value: shows the original value of the column as a list separated by commas.
- Summatory: Sum all the values of a column.
- Count All: Count all the values informed in a column.
