## Column ID

Where you create a column, the `column name` (name displayed in the database) is the same as the `column id` (the metadata persisted in your notes). You can change the column ID in the column settings. This ID is used by the **filters**, so keep that in mind when choosing what column to filter.

## YAML & Dataview Inline Fields

The plugin works with YAML and dataview inline fields, but looks for metadata in YAML by default. To make it work with inline fields, you have two options :

- You can toggle `enable inline field as default` in database or plugin global settings, and you can choose between putting the inline fields at the top, the bottom or after the last field  ;
- Or you can change it in the column's settings to use it with one property only. This change will not convert the underlying YAML to an inline format until you edit one of the cells in the column.

If there is no metadata in your notes, it will be created when you fill the corresponding cell in the database.

## Nested Metadata

You can add nested metadata by writing something like `metadata1.metadata2` in the column setting under `Behavior > column id`, which will render nested metadata separated by one space :

```
---
metadata1:
 metadata2: something
---
```

If you want to add existing nested metadata, you'll have to abide by the format described above.
